# error codes: http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# E501: line too long
# E265: block comment should start with ‘# ‘
#   We have lots of comments that look like "##### HEADING #####" which violate
#   this rule, because they don't have a space after the first #. However,
#   they're still perfectly reasonable comments, so we disable this rule.
# W602: deprecated form of raising exception
#   We do this in a few places to modify the exception message while preserving
#   the traceback. See this blog post for more info:
#   http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200711/rethrowing_exceptions_in_python.html
#   It's a little unusual, but we have good reasons for doing so, so we disable
#   this rule.
